# godot-raymarcher
 I was curious about raymarching so I created this following the two-part video series [Procedural 3D Engine. Ray Marching OpenGL Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUaYxqkrfjA), [Advanced Procedural 3D Graphics. Ray Marching Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i12pFwXlOGw). I chose to use Godot because I have been curious about it for a awhile and also because the shading language is very similar to GLSL (although some annoying differences..) which I am most familiar with.
